# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + True`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 9`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## Program

```

a = (0 == True)

b = (False == False)

c = (True + True)

d = (False + 9)

print("a is", a)

print("b is", b)

print("c:", c)

print("d:", d)

```

## Output

## Result

Thus,the PPython program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False is created successfully.
